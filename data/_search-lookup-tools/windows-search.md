As the name suggests, Windows Search is a built-in tool on Windows operating systems that enables users to search for files, folders, apps, and documents on their computer quickly and easily. The product was first introduced in Windows Vista and has since become an essential tool for Windows users. In this guide, we will explore all the features of Windows Search and how to use them.

## How to Access Windows Search

Accessing Windows Search is relatively easy. You can either use the search bar on the taskbar or use the keyboard shortcut Windows Key + S to launch the search function.

## Search Filters

One of the most powerful features of Windows Search is the search filters. The filters enable users to search for files based on different criteria such as file type, date modified, size, and others. 

To use the search filters, you need to click on the "Filter" button displayed on the search bar or press the "Ctrl+Shift+F" keyboard shortcut. Once you’ve accessed the filter panel, you can specify the search parameters and see filtered results reflecting your search criteria.

## Advanced Query Syntax

Windows Search also features an advanced query syntax that allows you to search for files based on specific keywords. For instance, by using specific keywords, you can search for files of a particular file type, created by a specific user or search for exact phrases within a document.

The keywords you can use include "filename:," "kind:," "datemodified:," " datetaken:," "owner:," and others. Using these keywords allows you to refine your search further, improving accuracy and efficiency.

## Search Indexing

Windows Search uses a search indexing feature, which compiles a list of all the files and documents on your computer and creates an index. This index allows users to find files quicker and without an essential in-depth search of each folder’s directory.

In case some files are not appearing in the search results or not getting indexed, you may use the "Indexing Options" dialog box to specify the location of the files or folders. Here, you can select the folder(s) you wish to index and add them to the index.

## Conclusion

Windows Search is a powerful tool that enables Windows users to find files, folders, apps, and documents quickly and efficiently. Understanding how to use the various features, filtering, advanced query syntax, and search indexing, makes searching a breeze. By following the tips outlined in this guide, you can harness the full power of Windows Search, and speed up your computer usage.
