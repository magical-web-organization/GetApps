## Screen Mirror to LG Smart TV: A Step-by-Step Guide

Are you tired of watching your favorite movies and shows on your small device screen? Worry no more! With the right software, you can screen mirror your devices to your LG Smart TV with ease. In this article, we will guide you through the process of screen mirroring to your LG Smart TV hassle-free.

### What is Screen Mirroring?

Screen mirroring is a technique that allows you to display the screen of your device to another screen wirelessly. It is useful when you want to show your device's screen to a larger audience, or when you want to watch content on a bigger screen.

### How to Screen Mirror to LG Smart TV

Screen mirroring to an LG Smart TV requires the use of compatible software. Here's how to do it:

1. Download and install the "LG Screen Share" app on your device.

2. Connect your device and LG Smart TV to the same Wi-Fi network.

3. Launch the LG Screen Share app on your device.

4. On your LG Smart TV, go to "Screen Share" in the home menu.

5. Select "LG Screen Share" from the list of available options.

6. Your LG Smart TV will display a PIN code.

7. Enter the PIN code displayed on your LG Smart TV into the LG Screen Share app on your device.

8. Your device's screen will now be displayed on your LG Smart TV.

### Other Options for Screen Mirroring

Aside from the LG Screen Share app, there are other options available for screen mirroring to your LG Smart TV. Here are some of them:

- Google Home app - This app allows you to cast your device's screen to your LG Smart TV. Simply connect your device and LG Smart TV to the same Wi-Fi network and select your TV from the list of available devices on the Google Home app.

- Miracast - This is a wireless display standard that allows you to mirror your device's screen to your LG Smart TV. Some devices already have Miracast built-in, but you can also purchase a Miracast dongle to enable screen mirroring on non-Miracast devices.

- HDMI cable - If wireless screen mirroring is not an option, you can use an HDMI cable to connect your device to your LG Smart TV. Simply connect one end of the HDMI cable to your device and the other end to your LG Smart TV's HDMI port.

### Conclusion

Screen mirroring to your LG Smart TV is a great way to enjoy your favorite movies and shows on a bigger screen. With the right software and a few simple steps, you can display your device's screen wirelessly to your LG Smart TV hassle-free. We hope this article has been helpful in guiding you through the screen mirroring process!
