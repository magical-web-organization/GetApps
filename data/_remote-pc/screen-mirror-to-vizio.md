## Introduction

Screen Mirror to Vizio is a technology that allows users to share the screen of their smartphone or computer with their Vizio TV wirelessly. This feature is particularly useful for users who want to enjoy their favorite videos, photos, or games on a larger screen without the need for cables, adapters, or other complicated setups.

In this article, we will explain how Screen Mirror to Vizio works, what devices are supported, and how to set it up in a few simple steps.

## How does Screen Mirror to Vizio work?

Screen Mirror to Vizio uses the Miracast technology, which allows devices to mirror their screens wirelessly over Wi-Fi Direct. Wi-Fi Direct is a technology that enables devices to communicate directly without the need for a wireless router, which means that you can use Screen Mirror to Vizio even if you don't have an active Wi-Fi network.

When you enable Screen Mirror to Vizio on your device, it will scan for available Miracast receivers within range, and display a list of compatible devices. Once you select your Vizio TV from the list, your device will establish a direct connection with your TV, and start streaming the contents of your screen. 

## What devices are supported?

Screen Mirror to Vizio is compatible with most Android devices running Android 4.2 or later, and most Windows PCs running Windows 8.1 or later. In addition, some newer Macs running macOS Yosemite or later also support Miracast, but you may need to download and install a third-party app to enable the feature.

To check if your device supports Screen Mirror to Vizio, go to Settings > Display > Cast Screen (Android) or Settings > System > Display > Connect to a wireless display (Windows/Mac), and see if your Vizio TV appears on the list of available devices.

## How to set up Screen Mirror to Vizio

To use Screen Mirror to Vizio, follow these simple steps:

1. Ensure that both your device and your Vizio TV are connected to the same Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi Direct. If you don't have an active Wi-Fi network, you can still use Wi-Fi Direct by going to the Wi-Fi settings on your device, and enabling Wi-Fi Direct.
2. On your Vizio TV, press the Input button on your remote, and select Screen Mirroring. Your TV will display a message that it is waiting for a device to connect.
3. On your device, go to Settings > Display > Cast Screen (Android) or Settings > System > Display > Connect to a wireless display (Windows/Mac).
4. Select your Vizio TV from the list of available devices. Your device will now connect to your TV, and start mirroring your screen.

## Conclusion

Overall, Screen Mirror to Vizio is an easy and convenient way to share your smartphone or computer screen with your Vizio TV, and enjoy your favorite content on a larger display. It is compatible with most Android devices, Windows PCs, and some newer Macs, and uses the Miracast technology to establish a direct wireless connection between your device and your TV. Whether you want to watch a movie, play a game, or show off your photos, Screen Mirror to Vizio makes it simple and seamless.
