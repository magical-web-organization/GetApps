Angry Birds Space, developed by Rovio Entertainment, is the fourth main installment in the popular Angry Birds series. Released in March 2012, the game brings a new twist to the traditional physics-based puzzle game genre by introducing gravity fields and new gameplay mechanics. 

In this article, we will explore the gameplay, characters, and levels of the popular game, as well as some tips and tricks to help you beat the game.

## Gameplay

Angry Birds Space follows the same goal as its predecessors: to destroy the pigs and their structures using birds with different abilities. However, in this game, the birds are launched from a launchpad located on a variety of planets, each with their own gravity field.

Players must use the gravity of the planet to their advantage, adjusting the trajectory of the birds mid-flight to hit their targets. The game also introduces new birds and power-ups, including the ice bird, which freezes structures and objects when it crashes into them.

## Characters

As with the previous games in the series, Angry Birds Space features a cast of colorful and quirky birds with different abilities. In this game, however, the birds are dressed in space suits to fit the game's theme. 

The game also adds several new characters, including the Lazer Bird, which can vaporize structures, and the Space Egg, which expands when tapped, causing destruction in its wake.

## Levels

Angry Birds Space features over 200 levels spread across several planets and galaxies. Each planet has its own unique characteristics, including the gravity field and other obstacles. 

Players must complete levels to advance through the game, with new levels unlocking as you progress.

## Tips and Tricks

To beat Angry Birds Space, it's important to remember the game's central mechanic: gravity. Use the gravity of the planet to your advantage, adjusting the trajectory of the bird mid-flight to hit your target.

Experiment with different birds and power-ups to figure out which works best on each level. And don't forget to pay attention to the environment and structures, which can offer clues on how to beat the level.

## Conclusion

Angry Birds Space offers a fresh take on the physics-based puzzle game genre, with new gameplay mechanics and gravity fields that add a new layer of strategy to the game. With its colorful cast of characters and over 200 levels, the game is sure to provide hours of entertainment for fans of the series and newcomers alike.
