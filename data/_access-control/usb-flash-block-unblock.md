## USB Flash Block/Unblock: A Handy Software for USB Drive Control

USB flash drives have become an essential part of our lives, from storing important files and documents to carrying entertainment and multimedia. While they are convenient, they also pose security threats when it comes to sensitive information. This is where USB Flash Block/Unblock comes in handy. 

### What is USB Flash Block/Unblock?

USB Flash Block/Unblock is a software developed by iWesoft that allows users to control the access to their USB flash drives. The software features a simple interface that allows users to block or unblock their USB drive with just a few clicks.

### How does it work?

Once installed on a computer or laptop, USB Flash Block/Unblock scans for all the USB flash drives connected to the system. The user can then select a specific flash drive they want to block or unblock. 

#### Blocking a USB flash drive

When the user blocks a USB flash drive, the software restricts any read or write access to the device. This means that any files or data on the USB drive cannot be accessed until the user unblocks it.

#### Unblocking a USB flash drive

To unblock the drive, the user simply needs to select it from the list of connected flash drives and click on the "Unblock" button. The device will then regain read and write access, making it available for use.

### Benefits of Using USB Flash Block/Unblock
