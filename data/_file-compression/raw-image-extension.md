If you are a photographer or a designer, you might be familiar with the RAW image format. RAW images are high-quality uncompressed images that retain all the details of the original image file. Although RAW images provide better quality than JPEG images, they require special software to view and edit. Fortunately, Microsoft has developed a software called Raw Image Extension that allows you to view and edit RAW images in Windows 10.

## What is Raw Image Extension?

Raw Image Extension is a software developed by Microsoft that adds support for RAW image formats in the Windows 10 operating system. With this software, you can open and view RAW images directly from the Windows 10 File Explorer or from any Windows application that supports file preview. 

Raw Image Extension supports various RAW image formats, including CR2, NEF, ARW, RW2, RAF, DNG, and many more. 

## How to install Raw Image Extension?

Raw Image Extension is available as a free download from the Microsoft Store. To install Raw Image Extension, follow these steps:

1. Open Microsoft Store on your Windows 10 PC.
2. Search for "Raw Image Extension" in the search bar.
3. Click on "Get" to start the installation process.
4. Wait for the installation to finish.

## How to use Raw Image Extension?

To use Raw Image Extension, follow these steps:

1. Double-click on any RAW image file.
2. Windows will prompt you to choose an application to open the file with. 
3. Select "Raw Image Extension" from the list of applications.
4. The RAW image will open in the Microsoft Photos app.

From here, you can view the RAW image and make basic edits such as rotating the image or adjusting brightness and contrast. If you need advanced editing tools, you can export the RAW image to another photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop.

## Conclusion

Raw Image Extension is a must-have software for photographers and designers who work with RAW images. It allows you to open and view RAW images directly from the Windows 10 File Explorer, which saves you time from having to use a separate RAW image viewer software. With its support for various RAW image formats and its intuitive interface, Raw Image Extension is a valuable addition to any Windows 10 PC.
