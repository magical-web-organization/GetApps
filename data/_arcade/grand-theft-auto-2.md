Grand Theft Auto 2 (commonly abbreviated as GTA 2) is an open-world action game developed by DMA Design (currently known as Rockstar North) and published by Rockstar Games in 1999. The game is set in an imaginary city, Anywhere City, that is divided into three districts: Downtown, Residential, and Industrial. Players take on the role of a criminal and are free to roam the city and complete missions, while also facing the consequences of their actions from law enforcement.

## Gameplay

GTA 2 takes place in a top-down perspective, allowing players to view the entirety of the city at once. The game offers a wide range of vehicles to choose from, ranging from cars and motorcycles to tanks and helicopters. Players are also armed with a variety of weapons such as pistols, shotguns, and flamethrowers, further adding to the mayhem.

The game's storyline is divided into several minor subplots, each with its own set of missions. Players have to complete these missions to progress in the game and unlock new content. One notable feature of GTA 2 is the "respect" system, where completing tasks for certain gangs or factions would gain the player's respect and access to specific areas or items.

## History

GTA 2 was the second installment in the Grand Theft Auto series and was developed for Windows, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. The game received critical acclaim for its open-world gameplay and satirical take on American culture.

Despite being a massive hit, the game generated some controversy for its themes of violence, crime, and drug use. The game was banned in Brazil and Malaysia, while others called for it to be banned in the UK.

## Legacy

GTA 2 was a turning point for the open-world genre, inspiring many subsequent games to follow its formula. The game's influence can be seen in later titles like the 3D Grand Theft Auto games, Saints Row, and Watch Dogs.

In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto 2 is a classic game that set the standard for future open-world games. Its blend of satire, violence, and crime made it a controversial hit that inspired future titles in the genre. For anyone interested in the history of video games, GTA 2 is an essential piece of video game history that deserves recognition.
