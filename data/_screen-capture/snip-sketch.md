## Introduction

Microsoft has released a new screen capture and annotation tool integrated into Windows 10 called Snip & Sketch. This tool allows you to capture screenshots or snippets of your screen, and make annotations or edits to them. In this article, we will dive into the features and capabilities of Snip & Sketch.

## Getting Started with Snip & Sketch

To access Snip & Sketch, simply press the **Windows key + Shift + S** on your keyboard. This will bring up a toolbar at the top of your screen, which allows you to capture different types of screenshots or snippets. You can select the type of capture you want by clicking on the corresponding button on the toolbar.

Once you have captured the screen, the image will be automatically saved to your clipboard. You can then paste the image into an application, such as Microsoft Paint or Word, and make any necessary edits or annotations.

## Features of Snip & Sketch

One of the key features of Snip & Sketch is the ability to create and draw on screenshots or snippets. You can use various tools, such as a pen or pencil, to make annotations or highlight certain areas of the image. You can also use the eraser tool to undo any mistakes or clear any unwanted marks.

Another feature of Snip & Sketch is the ability to crop the image to a specific size or shape. This is useful if you only want to capture a certain part of the screen or if you want to make the screenshot more aesthetically pleasing.

Snip & Sketch also allows you to save the image as a file on your computer. You can choose the format of the image, such as PNG or JPEG, and select the location where you want to save the file to.

## Conclusion

Overall, Snip & Sketch is a powerful and intuitive screen capture and annotation tool. It offers a variety of features that allow you to easily capture, edit, and save screenshots or snippets of your screen. Whether you are a professional designer or an everyday user, Snip & Sketch is a useful tool that can enhance your productivity and workflow.
