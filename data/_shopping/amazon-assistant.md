## Introduction

As one of the world's largest online retailers, Amazon offers a vast selection of products ranging from clothing and electronics to groceries and home goods. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to navigate the site and find the best deals. That's where Amazon Assistant comes in - a free web browser extension designed to enhance your online shopping experience both on Amazon and beyond.

## What is Amazon Assistant?

Amazon Assistant is a browser extension that provides real-time assistance as you shop online. It helps you compare prices, track your shipments, and notify you about deals and promotions from Amazon and its affiliated partners. The extension is available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera, and can be easily downloaded from the respective browser's extension store.

### Universal Wishlist

One of the key features of Amazon Assistant is the Universal Wishlist. This feature keeps track of all the items you've saved to your wishlist, regardless of whether they are on Amazon or not. You can add items to your wishlist by clicking on the Amazon Assistant icon in your browser, and then selecting "Add to Wishlist." You can access your wishlist from anywhere by logging into your Amazon account.

### Price Comparison

Another useful feature of Amazon Assistant is its ability to compare prices across different retailers. When you are browsing a product on a retailer's site, Amazon Assistant will automatically show you the price of that product on Amazon, as well as any other retailers selling the same item. This makes it easy to find the best deal without any extra effort.

### Deal Notifications

Amazon Assistant also provides notifications for deals and promotions currently available on Amazon and its affiliated partners. The extension will notify you of any sales or discounts on items you've previously viewed or added to your wishlist, making it easy to save money on the products you want.

### Product Recommendations

Lastly, Amazon Assistant provides personalized product recommendations based on your browsing history and purchases. This feature helps you discover new and relevant products that you might be interested in. You can also customize your product recommendations by adjusting your preferences in the Amazon Assistant settings.
