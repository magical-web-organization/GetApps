The HTTrack WebSite Copier is a free and open-source software that allows users to create backups for websites with ease. This software can be used to download and archive a website from the internet to a local directory on your computer.

In this article, we will dive into the features of HTTrack WebSite Copier, and how to use it to create backups for your website.

## How HTTrack WebSite Copier Works

HTTrack WebSite Copier works by creating a mirrored copy of the website you wish to download. This means it copies every file that makes up the website, starting from the web pages and the code to the media files, images and all other content.

In the process, the software also simulates the hyperlinks between the pages, allowing you to browse through the downloaded website offline, just as you would on the live website.

## Main Features

### Easy and Quick Backup Creation

HTTrack makes it easy for you to create backups for your website with just a few clicks. The software supports a range of website protocols including HTTP, FTP, and HTTPS, making it possible for you to backup your website, regardless of how it is hosted.

### Preserves the Website's Structure

The structure of your website is just as important as the individual pages and their contents. HTTrack WebSite Copier preserves the original structure of your website, including the files, directories and the hierarchy of the web pages.

### Mirrors a Website's External Links

As earlier mentioned, HTTrack WebSite Copier downloads a website as a mirrored copy, including all linked pages on that website. This means that as you navigate through the downloaded website, all external links contained in the original website will also work as they would on the live website.

### Support for Advanced Configuration Options

Should you need to customize the way the software works, HTTrack WebSite Copier comes with a comprehensive range of advanced configuration options. You can customize how the software handles different file formats, data, and connectivity settings to fit your specific needs.

## How to Use HTTrack WebSite Copier

Using HTTrack WebSite Copier is a straightforward process. Follow the steps below to download and create a backup for your website:

1. Download and install HTTrack WebSite Copier on your computer.
2. Launch the software and click the "Next" button to begin setting up the backup process.
3. Enter the website URL you wish to backup in the "Web Address" field.
4. Specify the destination folder where you wish to save the downloaded website.
5. Choose your preferred download options such as what to include or exclude from the backup.
6. Click the "Finish" button to start the backup process.

Depending on the size of your website and your computer's processing speed, the backup process may take some time to complete.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, HTTrack WebSite Copier is a powerful and easy-to-use software that simplifies the process of creating backups for your websites. It offers a range of features to give you complete control over the backup process, including support for advanced customization options.
