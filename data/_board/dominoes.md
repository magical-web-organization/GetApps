Dominoes is a classic tabletop game that originated in China during the Song Dynasty. This game involves a set of rectangular tiles, known as dominoes, that are marked with different numerical combinations on either side. The objective of the game is to empty your hand of dominoes while blocking your opponent from doing the same. 

With the advent of technology, this game has made its way onto various digital platforms, providing users with a modern twist to the traditional game. Let's dive into the different software versions of Dominoes.

## Dominoes Software

Some web-based platforms such as Dominoes Stars, Dominoes Club, and DominosPizzas offer real-time multiplayer games where users from around the world can compete with one another.
