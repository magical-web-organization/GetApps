## Minesweeper Original - A Classic Game for Puzzle Lovers

Minesweeper Original is a classic puzzle game that has been around since the early days of Windows. It was first included in the operating system in 1990 and has been a favorite of casual gamers ever since. The game is a single-player game that involves clearing a minefield without detonating any hidden mines. 

### Gameplay

The gameplay of Minesweeper Original is simple. The player is presented with a board that is covered in squares. Behind the squares, there are mines hidden. The objective of the game is to clear the board without detonating any mines. To clear the board, the player can left-click on a square to reveal what is behind it. If there is a mine, the game is over. 

If there is no mine, the square will reveal a number that indicates how many mines are adjacent to that square. Using this information, the player can deduce where the mines are and where it is safe to click. If the player is unsure, they can use the right-click to place a flag on a square that they believe contains a mine. 

Once all of the safe squares have been revealed and all of the mines have been flagged, the game is won. The objective is to clear the board in the shortest amount of time possible without detonating any mines.

### Popularity

Despite its simple gameplay and graphics, Minesweeper Original has remained popular among puzzle enthusiasts. It is a game that requires both logic and strategy, making it challenging while still being entertaining. 

Many people have spent countless hours playing the game, trying to beat their previous times or challenging their friends to see who can clear the board the fastest. Its popularity has led to numerous variations of the game being created, including a version for mobile devices. 

### Conclusion

Minesweeper Original may be a simple game, but it has stood the test of time and remains a classic among puzzle lovers. Its addictive gameplay and challenging objective make it a game that can be played over and over again. Whether you are an experienced player or new to the game, Minesweeper Original is definitely worth a try.
