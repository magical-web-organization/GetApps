## Gameplay

The gameplay of Need For Speed Underground is focused on illegal street racing. Players have to compete in races while evading the police and outrunning opponents. The game is set in a fictional city called Bayview, which is modeled after real-life cities like Los Angeles and New York.

Another feature that sets Need For Speed Underground apart from other racing games is its customization options. The game's extensive customization system allows players to create unique cars that reflect their personal style. The customization options range from basic paint jobs to advanced modifications like turbochargers and nitrous systems.

## Legacy

Need For Speed Underground's impact on the racing game genre cannot be overstated. It paved the way for later titles in the series, such as Need For Speed Most Wanted and Need For Speed Carbon. Even today, almost two decades after its release, the game remains popular among gamers and continues to inspire new titles in the genre.

In conclusion, Need For Speed Underground is the best racing game of all time. Its engaging gameplay, extensive customization options, and killer soundtrack set the bar for other racing games.
