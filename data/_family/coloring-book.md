Coloring books are not just for kids anymore. In recent years, adults have also jumped on the coloring book bandwagon as a way to relieve stress and unwind. But with the rise of digital technology, there is now an even better way to color: with coloring book software.

### What is Coloring Book Software?

Coloring book software is a digital tool that lets you color in illustrations using a computer or tablet. It offers a wide variety of features that traditional coloring books do not, such as different brushes, paint colors, and gradients. 

The software comes with a pre-designed set of images ranging from animal shapes, flowers, cars, famous buildings and so forth.
