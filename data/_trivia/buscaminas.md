Buscaminas, also known as Mine Sweeper, is a simple yet addictive game that has been enjoyed worldwide for decades. The game's objective is to uncover hidden mines on a grid while avoiding detonating them. In this article, we will explore the history, gameplay, and popularity of Buscaminas.

## Gameplay

The game consists of a square grid, where mines are hidden randomly beneath the tiles. The objective of the game is to reveal all tiles without detonating the mines. Each tile reveals a number that indicates the number of mines adjacent to it. Using logic and deduction, players must determine the location of hidden mines and mark them with a flag. The game is won when all non-mine tiles are revealed.

Apart from being a popular leisure activity, Buscaminas has been used as a tool to improve cognitive skills in adults and children. Studies have shown that playing the game can improve concentration, memory, and problem-solving skills.

## Conclusion
