Are you a brand enthusiast? Do you think you know everything about logos and brands? Then Logo Quiz Plus is the perfect game for you! Logo Quiz Plus is a fun and addictive game that challenges your brand knowledge skills. This game is available for both Android and iOS users and is free to download from the app stores.

## How to play
Playing Logo Quiz Plus is very simple. You will be presented with a logo of a brand and you have to guess the name of the brand. You will have a set of letters that you can choose from to form the correct name. The game is divided into levels, and each level has a set of logos to guess. The logos range from global brands to local brands. There are more than 1500 logos to guess in the game, so it will keep you busy for hours.

## Hints
If you find it difficult to guess a logo, you can use hints. There are three types of hints available in the game. The first hint will remove some of the letters that are not required to form the name. The second hint will reveal one of the letters that are required to form the name. The third hint will show you the correct name of the brand. However, using hints will reduce your score, so use them wisely.

## Scoring
Your score is based on two factors: the number of logos you guess correctly and the time you take to guess each logo. The quicker you guess a logo, the higher your score will be. You can also earn bonus points by guessing multiple logos correctly in a row without using hints. Your score is displayed at the end of each level, and you can compare it with other players’ scores from around the world.

## Conclusion
Logo Quiz Plus is a fun and addictive game that will test your brand knowledge skills. It is a great way to spend your free time and challenge yourself. So, what are you waiting for? Download Logo Quiz Plus from the app store and start playing today!
