## Integration with Windows 10

One of the advantages of Bing for Windows 10 is the seamless integration with the operating system. The search engine can provide more relevant and personalized results based on user's location, search history, and settings. Bing can also perform specific search tasks directly from the start menu and will display suggested search results as the user types in a query. Additionally, Bing offers advanced search capabilities that are built-in to Windows 10, such as searching for files and documents.

## Search Features

Another notable feature of Bing for Windows 10 is the quick and easy access to Cortana. With Cortana, users can perform voice searches, set reminders, and track packages, among other tasks. Additionally, Bing is compatible with Microsoft Edge, Microsoft's web browser, providing users with hands-free, voice-powered searching capabilities.
