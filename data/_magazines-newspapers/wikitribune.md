The rise of fake news has been a major concern for our modern society. With the increasing amount of fake news being spread, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish what is fact and what is fiction. Wikitribune is a software that seeks to address this issue by providing reliable and factual news to its users.

## What is Wikitribune

Wikitribune is a software that combines the principles of Wikipedia and professional journalism to produce factual news articles. The software was founded by Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, and launched in April 2017.

The idea behind Wikitribune is to provide a platform where professional journalists work alongside volunteers to produce news articles. The volunteers help to fact-check the articles and ensure that the information provided in the article is accurate.

## How Does Wikitribune Work

Wikitribune works by using professional journalists to write news articles on the platform. These articles are then reviewed by volunteers who fact-check the information presented in the article. If any inaccuracies are found, the volunteers can submit edits to the article to correct the inaccuracies.

The platform also has a feature where users can make a financial contribution to the platform to support the work of the journalists.

## Benefits of Wikitribune

Wikitribune has several benefits, some of which includes:

- Reliable news: Wikitribune provides reliable news by ensuring that all the news articles are fact-checked by volunteers.
- Combats fake news: The software aims to combat fake news by providing factual news articles to its users.
- Transparency: Wikitribune is transparent about its funding as users can make financial contributions to support the work of the journalists.
- Collaborative: The software allows for collaboration between professional journalists and volunteers to produce quality news articles.

## Conclusion

Wikitribune is a software that aims to provide reliable and factual news to combat fake news. The platform uses a collaborative approach to produce quality news articles by combining the efforts of professional journalists and volunteers. By ensuring that all news articles are fact-checked, users can be confident in the accuracy of the information provided.
