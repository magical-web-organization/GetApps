## What is eDonkey2000?

eDonkey2000 is a P2P (peer-to-peer) file sharing software that was first released in 2000 by MetaMachine. It quickly became a hit due to its innovative use of both server-based and decentralized P2P technology. This allowed for faster and more reliable file sharing compared to other P2P programs available at the time.

## How does it work?

Unlike traditional P2P file sharing programs, eDonkey2000 uses a decentralized network of servers to help users find and connect to each other. This system is called the "server-based network". Once connected, users can exchange files directly with each other using the "decentralized network".

## Features

Some of the key features of eDonkey2000 include:

- Comprehensive search capabilities that make it easier to find exactly what you're looking for
- Built-in security measures to protect users from malware, viruses, and other online threats
- Support for large files and collections, making it perfect for sharing entire albums or movies
- Ability to resume interrupted downloads, even after disconnecting from the network
- Full Unicode support for international users

## Is it still in use?

While eDonkey2000 is no longer actively developed, it continues to be used by a small but devoted userbase. This is due in part to its reputation for being one of the most reliable and user-friendly P2P programs ever created. Additionally, many users appreciate the fact that eDonkey2000 does not require excessive system resources or bandwidth to run.

## Conclusion

eDonkey2000 may have been released over two decades ago, but its impact on the world of file sharing is still felt today. Its innovative use of both server-based and decentralized P2P technology revolutionized the industry and paved the way for many other P2P programs that followed. If you're looking for a reliable, comprehensive, and user-friendly P2P file sharing program, eDonkey2000 is definitely worth checking out.
