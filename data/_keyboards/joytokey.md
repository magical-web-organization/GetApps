## JoyToKey: How to Use Joysticks for PC Gaming

If you're a PC gamer who prefers using a joystick or gamepad instead of a keyboard and mouse, JoyToKey software might be just what you need to enhance your gaming experience. JoyToKey allows you to map your joystick or gamepad inputs to keyboard and mouse outputs, allowing you to play games that do not support the use of a controller.

### What is JoyToKey?

JoyToKey software is a program that enables you to convert joystick/gamepad inputs into keyboard and mouse actions. The software maps joystick input to keyboard keys and mouse actions, thereby allowing you to control applications that do not have native joystick support.

### Features of JoyToKey

JoyToKey software comes with several features that make it useful for PC gamers. Here are some of the features:

- Easy to Install - JoyToKey is straightforward to download and install.
- Customizable Mapping - You can map joystick and gamepad buttons to keyboard keys at your discretion.
- Preset Mapping Profiles - JoyToKey comes with preset mapping profiles for several popular games with controllers such as FIFA, GTA5, etc.
- Flexible Settings - You can set up profiles for every game, thereby having an optimal gaming experience.
- Joystick Emulation - JoyToKey can simulate and control the keyboard and mouse with your joystick or gamepad.
- Auto Profile Switching - JoyToKey can recognize which game you're playing and switch your profiles automatically, allowing for hassle-free playing.
- Supports Multiple Joysticks - JoyToKey supports multiple joystick/gamepad inputs, allowing you to use up to 16 joysticks on a single PC.
- Low CPU Usage - JoyToKey only uses a minimal amount of CPU resources, thus having no effect on your system's performance.

### How to Use JoyToKey

- First, download and install the latest version of JoyToKey from the official website.
- After installation, launch the program and connect your joystick or gamepad to your PC.
- Next, click the "Create" button to create a new profile.
- In the new window, select your joystick or gamepad as the controller and press "OK."
- Choose the button you want to map and click on it.
- Click on the button you wish to assign the joystick/button and press "OK."
- Repeat the previous steps for all the buttons you wish to map.
- Once your profile is ready, assign it to the game you want to play.
- Play the game as you would normally use a joystick or gamepad.

With JoyToKey's customization options, you can create map buttons to specific keys or even assign custom macros to certain buttons, making it handy for productivity tools.

#### Conclusion

JoyToKey software can turn your joystick or gamepad into a full-fledged controller for your PC. With its customizable mapping options and support for multiple input devices, gaming becomes more enjoyable, and productivity gains can be achieved in-built hence giving users a wholly reasonable low-cost solution to their PC gaming.
