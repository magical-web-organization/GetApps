In this article, we will explore the different types of screensavers available on Windows 7 and how they can enhance your desktop experience.

## What are screensavers?

Screensavers are programs that automatically appear on your computer screen after a certain period of inactivity. They are designed to prevent image burn-in on your display, which can occur when the same image is displayed for an extended period. Screensavers work by continuously changing the image displayed on your screen, preventing any static image from being displayed for too long.

## Types of screensavers available on Windows 7

Windows 7 ships with a range of screensavers that can be accessed via the Personalization settings. Some of the popular screensavers include:

### 2. Mystify

The Mystify screensaver displays a series of multicolored lines that move in a hypnotic pattern around your screen. The lines change shape and color, creating fascinating visuals that will add a touch of mystery to your desktop.

### 3. Ribbons

The Ribbons screensaver displays ribbons of different colors moving across your screen in a captivating dance. The ribbons move gracefully, creating an elegant display that is sure to impress anyone who sees your computer screen.

### 4. Aurora

The Aurora screensaver displays a beautiful animation of the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis. The visuals are breathtaking, transporting you to a different world where the sky is alive with color and movement.
